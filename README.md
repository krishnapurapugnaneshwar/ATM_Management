This project implements a simple ATM simulation system in Java, designed to demonstrate
object-oriented programming principles, dynamic user management, and secure user interactions.
The system allows multiple users to perform basic ATM operations such as checking balance, depositing,
withdrawing money, and securely managing their PIN.

Features:
-> Multi-User Support: 
      Manage multiple user accounts dynamically without hardcoding additional objects.
-> Basic Banking Operations:
      Check Balance
      Deposit Money
      Withdraw Money
      Pin Change
-> Secure PIN Management:
      Users can change their PIN after verifying the existing one.
-> Dynamic Workflow:
      Users interact with the system in real-time with an easy-to-use console-based interface.
-> Error Handling: 
      Ensures invalid inputs or insufficient balance are handled gracefully.
-> Technologies Used:
      Java (Core Concepts: Classes, Interfaces, Arrays, Loops)
      Scanner for user input
      Object Oriented Programming.
